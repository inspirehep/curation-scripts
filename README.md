# Curation scripts

This repo contains scripts that are meant to implement one-off large-scale changes to INSPIRE or gather complex information.

To add a new script, create a new directory under `scripts` containing a single `script.py` file implementing the script logic, then create a PR. Auxiliary files will be generated automatically when merging to master.
